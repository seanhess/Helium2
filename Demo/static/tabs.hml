        background="" - means to attempt to set a backgroundColor property on whatever it is
        
        there can be a default handler, that just passes it through to the main object
        
        self.view is a misnomer. There is always an underlying object, right? We can make that assumption. So, the default attribute handler just passes it through. 
        
        so, left/right/top/bottom would ... would what? 
        
        a single handler can catch several of the attributes and do something cool?
        
        That's... really cool. I like the idea of a pass-through. Right?
